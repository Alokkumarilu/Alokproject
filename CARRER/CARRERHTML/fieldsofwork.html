    <h1> FIELDS OF WORKS</h1>
    <p>“Connected solutions are creating new jobs. People with professional experience and software skills have especially good chances, which includes mechanical engineers and software developers alike.”</p><br>
    <p><b>A perfect fit for everyone: our focus areas</b></p><br>
    <p>We are about to be one of the leading companies worldwide in the field of the Internet of Things. See in which other areas we strive to bring forward pioneering innovations.</p><br>
    <p><b><u>Research</u></b></p>
    <p>At the Corporate Sector Division Research and Advance Engineering, you can see how your ideas have a direct effect on products. Help find innovative solutions for companies and customers that simultaneously make a difference in terms of efficiency, quality, and reliability. At our in-house research centre in Renningen for example, you will find the perfect equipment to search for new ideas and bring forward our innovative power.</p><br>
    <p><b><u>Engineering</u></b></p><br>
    <p>The demand for electric and electronic systems (E/E systems) in modern vehicles are rising steadily. As the number of systems in the on-board network continues to grow, the increasing exchange of data through vehicle connectivity must also be managed reliably.

        <br>
         At Bosch Engineering, you will bring forward new mobility solutions and contribute to the powertrain's efficiency and the comfort of today’s vehicles.
        
        </p>
        <p><b><u>The Internet of Things</u></b></p><br>
        <p>The Internet of Things offers countless new possibilities and has a huge influence on almost every area of our lives — for example on mobility, energy, manufacturing, agriculture, health, homes, and building. That's why, at Bosch, almost every second position deals with software and the way we can improve and further develop this. <br>

            You can join us in bringing the Internet of Things forward, making products smarter, and establishing completely new technologies.</p>
         <p><b><u>Manufacturing</u></b></p><br>
         <p>With our Industry 4.0 solutions for connected manufacturing, we optimise production and logistics processes. We develop solutions to make machines communicate with each other and thus speed up production and improve safety at the same time. By collecting, visualising, and analysing machine, process, and sensor data, you can help us offer a whole new world of opportunities for companies.</p>
