    <h1><b>WHY BRIGHTEN CONTROLS LLP?</b></h1>
    <p>What we offer our associates</p><br>
<p>For more than 130 years, we have offered our associates around the world the opportunity to shape the future with a leading global provider of technology and services: beneficial innovations that improve the quality of people’s lives, and save resources, drive our work. We encourage our associates to be individuals and see diversity as an asset. Our company enables its associates to strike a healthy balance between professional and personal aims, as we see this as a decisive means of promoting creativity and job satisfaction. This balance also shapes the foundation of our associates’ outstanding performance. Lifelong learning and a regular change of perspective are firmly anchored in our leadership culture. Our areas of activity are every bit as diverse as our locations around the world.

<p><b>It pays to work at Bosch</b></p>
<br>
<p>Lay the perfect foundation for the future: With our preventive healthcare program, the company pension scheme, and other benefits.</p><br>

<p>Our compensation for your work is not just good, it’s equitable. Pay structures at Bosch are fair and transparent. After all, we want to build a long-term, successful working relationship with you. We also add attractive benefits to your basic salary, such as our company pension scheme. And the more you put into your work, the more you'll get out of it — as part of our work bonus scheme. <br>

    The Bosch benefit plan offers a simple, profitable system for company retirement benefits. To help you accumulate retirement savings, we offer company contributions. Additionally, you can contribute directly from your salary. The contributions are invested in stocks and interest-bearing securities. We are careful to provide you with a secure and sustainable investment strategy. Your savings will be available as additional income once you retire. <br>
    
    But there are more ways we appreciate your work and encourage you to contribute your ideas. We have thus introduced our company suggestion system: Suggestions that deliver results, such as optimised processes or improved product quality, are rewarded with bonuses of up to 150,000 euros. The success we have demonstrated in gathering associates' ideas and putting them into practice received accolades from the Deutsches Institut für Betriebswirtschaft (dib) in 2008.</p> <br>
